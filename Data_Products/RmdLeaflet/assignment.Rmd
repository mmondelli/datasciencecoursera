## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Let's Go

Main touristic sights in Rio de Janeiro:

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(leaflet)

df <- read.csv('./sights.csv', header = TRUE)
                
df %>%
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers()

```
