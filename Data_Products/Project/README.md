Internet Service in Brazil
=========================

This is an shiny application developed for the final project of the Developing Data Products course (Coursera).

The main objective is to present some statistics about the internet service in Brazil graphically.

The dataset was obtained through the 'transparency portal' maintained by the Brazilian government and can be accesed [here](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/resultado-consolidado-da-pesquisa-banda-larga-fixa).

The main features of the application are:

* The *Statistics* menu, where the user can choose an internet company to analyze the percentage of service channels used in each state by year (2015 and 2016). 
* By choosing a state, the user can view the percentage of scores on the quality of service, assigned by users in that state (for a specific company).
* Also, the application allows access and filtering the dataset according to the user's interest in the *Dataset* menu. 

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/mmondelli/datasciencecoursera/tree/gh-pages/Data_Products/Project).

The application can be accessed [here](https://mmondelli.shinyapps.io/data_products_project_-_coursera/).
