## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the final project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata), which purpose is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

For this, we will read the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform some analyses, and produce a tidy output dataset.

You can find more details about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
